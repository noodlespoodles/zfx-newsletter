DXY is on a rip up overnight. Bias is long but wait for a decent pullback. Watch the indexes to correlate. 
NQ recovered somewhat in the overnight but expect more aggressive selling. Lots of options flow (aka resistance)between 24760 and 24822. Unlikely to be broken this session but the correction might be over
ES, like NQ,same same
CL is in a range. Sell the top, buy the bottom, don't diddle in the middle
GC had two clear legs down overnight. Wait for price action to develop and potentially play the range with a short intraday bias.
6E is the flip side of DXY - wait for a pullback first though.
VIX is climbing
