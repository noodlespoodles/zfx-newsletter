ES continues to grind up overnight. Resistance towards 6790, stronger at 6800 - a psychological number. Speaking of which, support around 6750.
NQ grinds up too. 25,000 will be a large resistance point so expect some volatility on the way and it mirrors ES.
CL is sinking with some light volatility overnight. Looks to be in a range for now as todays positioning is digested.
GL against its often index opposing movement grinds up too. Interesting to see which will capitulate. The flight to safety might take hold ahead of uncertainty in the USA.
EURUSD is probably part of a bigger range with a fairly defined middle. Be careful of with trend positioning. Likely trades fading the extremes.
DXY after yesterdays rally looks to have broken up out of a bull flag overnight. Beware the forming range per EURUSD.
VIX sunk overnight but expect a spike as dealers position for the month and do so in the face of political uncertainty.
