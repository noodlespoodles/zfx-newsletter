## Market Overview

Tech stocks are driving global indices to fresh highs as OpenAI's valuation soars to $500 billion, fuelling optimism around the AI boom (or bubble). S&P 500 futures are up 0.3% whilst Nasdaq 100 futures lead with a 0.6% gain.

Despite the positive momentum, markets are navigating the first US government shutdown in seven years. The shutdown has delayed key economic data, with the non-farm payrolls report cancelled. However, Fed rate cut expectations remain intact—a quarter-point cut in October is 98% priced in, with an 80% chance of another cut in December.

Bitcoin has risen 1.2% to $118,952.45, Ether is up 1.2% at $4,390.15. The 10-year Treasury yield is holding steady at 4.10%.

The government shutdown adds an element of uncertainty, particularly around data flows and potential political volatility. However, with Fed rate cuts 98% priced in for October, the path of least resistance might be, for today at least.

Watch for volatility around the 8:30 AM ET jobless claims release, and keep an eye on DXY strength as it could pressure risk assets if the breakout continues.

Trade the levels, not the noise.

## Instruments watch

### ES (S&P 500 Futures)
ES continues to grind up overnight. Resistance towards 6790, stronger at 6800 - a psychological number. If we break, the brakes are off. Support around 6750.

### NQ (Nasdaq 100 Futures)
NQ grinds up too. 25,000 will be a large resistance point so expect some volatility on the way and it mirrors ES.

### CL (WTI Crude Oil)
CL is sinking with some light volatility overnight. Looks to be in a range for now as todays positioning is digested.

### GL (Gold)
GL against its often index opposing movement grinds up too. Interesting to see which will capitulate. The flight to safety might take hold ahead of uncertainty in the USA.

### EURUSD
EURUSD is probably part of a bigger range with a fairly defined middle. Be careful of with trend positioning. Likely trades fading the extremes.

### DXY (US Dollar Index)
DXY after yesterdays rally looks to have broken up out of a bull flag overnight. Beware the forming range per EURUSD.

### VIX (Volatility Index)
VIX sunk overnight but expect a spike as dealers position for the month and do so in the face of political uncertainty.

## Trader Tip

**Scalping stacked EMAs**

Trading is often complex. And that is fine. It can also be simple. This is an attractive notion. The problem is that this game requires you to outsmart other participants and take their money. Failing that, they'll take yours. Unless you are a massively funded entity and extremely clever, you're likely going to have to trade a relatively simple edge. Not to say that some of the best traders don't trade a simple edge. One such edge is to use the EMA (an expression of the average of the last specified number of bars) to wait for a trend to form and to take continuations.

Below is a clear uptrend on a 5 minute chart. When price pulls back to the 21 EMA, a trade is placed after the first bullish bar that closes back above, signifying the continuation of the trade. There are 2 trades, a 1R and 2R. Try it out. Many traders, notably Al Brooks, have been very successful with price action strategies, of which this is one.
