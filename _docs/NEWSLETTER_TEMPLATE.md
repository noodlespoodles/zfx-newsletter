## IMPORTANT RULES

### Data Integrity
- **NEVER fabricate FX support/resistance levels** - Only include if explicitly in sources
- **NEVER invent commodity prices** - Use only from Bloomberg/Benzinga
- **NEVER add made-up index values** - Trace every number to source
- **Chart commentary must be VERBATIM** - No additions, no embellishments

### Style Standards
- **No emojis anywhere** - Not in headings, not in content
- **Sentence case throughout** - "Market overview" not "Market Overview"
- **UK English spelling** - realised, whilst, colour, behaviour
- **Technical levels as zones** - "6,640-6,700 zone" not "6,675 resistance"
- **Times in ET** - 10:00 AM ET
- **Numbers with commas** - 6,650 not 6650

### Platform-Specific
- **No individual stock recommendations** - Only impact analysis
- **Focus on Traze tradeable instruments** - Indices, FX, commodities, crypto
- **Stock mentions = index impact only** - "NVDA rally adding points to Nasdaq"
