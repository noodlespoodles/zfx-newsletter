# Daily Newsletter Production Process

This checklist ensures consistent, high-quality newsletter production every day.

**Estimated Total Time:** 30-35 minutes
**Target Completion:** Before market open (7:30 AM ET)

---

## Stage 1: Input Collection (Manual - 10 min)

### Folder Setup

Navigate to: `_working/` folder

Create today's dated folder:
```bash
_working/YYYY-MM-DD/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ sources/
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ charts/
```

Example: `_working/2025-09-25/`

### Collect Source Documents

Place in `sources/` subfolder:
- [ ] **bloomberg.pdf** - "Stock Market Today" PDF
- [ ] **spotgamma.pdf** - "Founder's Notes" or "Key SG Levels"
- [ ] **tipranks.txt** - Market summary (text or PDF)
- [ ] **benzinga.pdf** - Morning dashboard (optional)
- [ ] **squeezemetrics.pdf** - Options flow (optional)

**Missing Sources:** Note which sources are unavailable (affects confidence)

### Collect Charts

Place in `charts/` subfolder:
- [ ] Screenshot S&P 500 futures (ES) - any filename OK
- [ ] Screenshot EUR/USD (6E) - any filename OK
- [ ] Screenshot GBP/USD - any filename OK (optional)
- [ ] Screenshot Gold (GC) - any filename OK
- [ ] Screenshot Oil (CL) - any filename OK
- [ ] Screenshot DXY - any filename OK
- [ ] Screenshot VIX - any filename OK

**Chart file naming:** Any naming convention is acceptable (e.g., "Screenshot 2025-09-25 144309.png" or "ES_2025-09-25.png")

### Create Chart Commentary

Create file: `charts/chart-comments.txt`

**Format:** One line per instrument, plain text, your trading commentary

**Example:**
```
DXY is on a rip up overnight. Bias is long but wait for a decent pullback. Watch the indexes to correlate.
NQ recovered somewhat in the overnight but expect more aggressive selling. Lots of options flow (aka resistance) between 24760 and 24822.
ES, like NQ, same same
CL is in a range. Sell the top, buy the bottom, don't diddle in the middle
GC had two clear legs down overnight. Wait for price action to develop and potentially play the range with a short intraday bias.
6E is the flip side of DXY - wait for a pullback first though.
VIX is climbing
```

**IMPORTANT:** This commentary will be used VERBATIM in the newsletter. Write exactly what you want to appear.

## Stage 2: Initialize (Claude Code - 2 min)

## Data Integrity Standards

### Absolute Requirements

**These rules must NEVER be violated:**

1. **Only use data directly from source documents**
   - If you can't find the number in a source PDF, don't include it
   - Never estimate, calculate, or approximate
   - Never use yesterday's data as a placeholder

2. **Chart commentary must be VERBATIM**
   - Copy EXACTLY from chart-comments.txt
   - No additions, no clarifications, no enhancements
   - If commentary says "GC had two legs down" - use ONLY that text

3. **Technical levels as zones/ranges only**
   - "6,640-6,700 resistance zone" ‚úì
   - "6,675 resistance" ‚úó (exact proprietary level)
   - "Upper 6,600s" ‚úì
   - "6,650" ‚úó (exact proprietary strike)

4. **No FX levels unless from sources**
   - If Bloomberg doesn't mention EUR/USD support/resistance, don't include it
   - Don't fabricate Fibonacci levels
   - Don't add "common sense" round numbers

5. **UK English spelling**
   - realised (not realized)
   - colour (not color)
   - centre (not center)
   - whilst (not while)
   - behaviour (not behavior)

### Common Fabrication Mistakes to Avoid

‚ùå **DON'T DO THIS:**
- "EUR/USD support at 1.1700, resistance at 1.1800" (if not in sources)
- "Gold holding well despite DXY surge" (if "despite DXY surge" not in chart-comments.txt)
- "S&P resistance at 6,675" (exact strike instead of zone)
- "Markets are BULLISH" (all caps for emphasis)
- "üìä Market Overview" (emoji in heading)

‚úì **DO THIS:**
- Only include FX levels if explicitly mentioned in Bloomberg or other sources
- Use EXACT text from chart-comments.txt: "GC had two legs down overnight"
- "S&P resistance zone: 6,640-6,700 area"
- "Markets are bullish" (sentence case)
- "Market overview" (no emoji, sentence case)

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Claude Fabricated Data

**Symptoms:**
- FX levels appear that weren't in sources
- Chart commentary includes context not in chart-comments.txt
- Numbers that don't match any source document

**Solution:**
1. STOP - do not proceed to HTML generation
2. Identify fabricated sections
3. Delete fabricated content
4. Ask Claude: "Regenerate [section name] using ONLY data from [specific source file]"
5. Manually verify every number against source

### Issue: Missing Critical Source

**Bloomberg or SpotGamma unavailable:**
1. Note in newsletter header: "LIMITED DATA - [Source] unavailable"
2. Skip sections that require missing source:
   - No Bloomberg = Skip market narrative
   - No SpotGamma = Skip technical levels
3. Proceed with available data only
4. Reduce confidence/scope of newsletter

**Optional sources missing (Benzinga, SqueezeMetrics):**
- Proceed normally, work with available data

### Issue: Low Extraction Confidence

**Causes:**
- Source files corrupted or unreadable
- Unusual PDF format
- Source file in wrong location

**Solutions:**
- Verify source files open correctly in PDF reader
- Check file is in `_working/YYYY-MM-DD/sources/` folder
- Try re-downloading source file
- Use alternative source if available

### Issue: Chart Images Not Displaying

**Causes:**
- Charts folder missing
- File paths incorrect
- Files not copied to archive

**Solutions:**
- Verify charts exist in `_working/YYYY-MM-DD/charts/`
- Check HTML uses relative paths: `charts/filename.png`
- Ensure charts copied to `_archive/YYYY-MM-DD/charts/`

### Issue: HTML Generation Failed

**Solutions:**
1. Verify template exists: `_templates/newsletter-template-traze.html`
2. Check draft file is valid markdown
3. Verify all chart files referenced in draft exist
4. Try regenerating: "Generate HTML from approved draft"
5. If still failing, use previous day's HTML as base and manually edit
